# Time-Series-Processing-with-Tensorflow

In this project we will explore 3 different tasks on Timeseries, using the nasdaq stocks dataset from 2007 to 2017.

## Instalation
To download the project just `git clone` the repository.
To install prerequisities:
```bash
cd Time-Series-Processing-with-Tensorflow
pip3 install requirements.txt
```

In the root directory there are 3 python files that implement the tasks at hand.

## Time Series Forecasting with LSTMs

## Outlier Detection using LSTM Autoencoder

## Dimensionality Reduction using CNNs Autoencoder

## Miscellaneous

## Collaborators
